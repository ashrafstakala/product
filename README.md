## What is a product management readme?
It is a brief overview of my approach to product management and teams. I usually share my product management readme when joining a new team or when new members join my team. It is **not** meant to replace getting to know each other through daily chats, 1:1 and other team interactions.

I took the idea from Katie Womersley's [Management readme](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b), and adapted it to be more focused on product management.

## My approach to product development
My product development approach is simple: **build products that customers absolutely love!**
 
I adopt a hands-on approach when it comes to product development. It's important for me to get as close to the product development as possible and I find that understanding the design & coding processes helps me to be a better product manager. This could mean creating design mock-ups or wireframes, reviewing code & repos, deployment processes, analysing data in SQL, cloud platform setups or API's and applications. 

It's also very important for me to get hands on with the product itself by using it the way a customer would. 

## Agile product development methods
I've worked in different development environments (small teams, big teams, medium teams) and I prefer using the agile method that works best based on the team or project in terms of allowing us to achieve our goals. Whether that is Scrum, Kanban or any other agile method.

I believe that a good understanding of the agile rituals are important. The daily stand-ups, grooming, planning, demo's and retro's are important as it allows the team to identify challenges and continuously improve on each development cycle.

When it comes to tools like Trello, Pivotal Tracker, and Jira I have no preference regarding which platform we use. Different tools work well with different teams and projects and I use whicever platform works best for the team.

## My communication style
I'm a bit old school in the sense that I prefer important info to be communicated via email, but face to face communication is just as important to me. I prefer to avoid long threaded back and forth emails by simply getting up and having a quick face to face chat. I generally reply to emails within 12 hours, but usually within 2 hours.

I'm available on all major messaging platforms like Slack, Skype, Teams, WhatsApp, Telegram and I generally tend to adopt the messaging platform my team uses as my deffault. I respond to messages within 1 hour, and usually within a few minutes.

## What I look for from management
Autonomy to make decisions that they themselves may not choose or agree with, but also being firm enough to put me back on the correct path when I may have strayed too far. Honest, critical feedback is also very important.

## What I look for from the team
Open and honest communication. Being comfortable enough to challenge each other in order to help the team grow, and a shared mission on what success means for the team, business and product. I believe the team should work together to define the product goals and KPI's, and each team member should take ownership and accountability of work they're responsible for.

## 1:1's
I find that 1:1's are great opportunities to talk about what's on your mind, goals, ambitions and to discuss any concerns or challenges you may be facing both at a professional and personal level. For me, 1:1's are not status meetings but I see the value in that should either party specicially want to discuss that from time to time.

I structure my 1:1's based on what works best for the manager I'm reporting to, and direct reports reporting into me. It's about finding what works best for both parties. I'm flexible based on schedules and preferences, although I generally tend to prefer bi-weekly 1:1 meetings.

## Meetings
When it comes to meetings, I definitely believe that less is more. Which is why I prefer to only attend meetings where my input or prescence is absolutely neccesary. I will also only schedule meetings where the agenda and meeting goals are clear to the attendees. Please keep me honest on this!
